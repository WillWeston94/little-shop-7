# Little Esty Shop

Our project was the creation of a web-app framework for an online retail store without an attached larger database.

## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that required us to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.  The framework is full-stack, and allows all merchants, users, and customers to see hypothetical "updates" in real-time.
